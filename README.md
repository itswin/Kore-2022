# Kore-2022 for team "1 Musketeer"

Much thanks to [aDg4b](https://www.kaggle.com/egrehbbt) on Kaggle for posting his amazing code from the Kore-2022-Beta competition.
I used it as a jumping off point for the main competition and it saved me lots of grunt work time.

Discussion for his bot located here:

Thanks to [Jasper](https://www.kaggle.com/jmerle) for his AMAZING visualization tool [Koreye](https://jmerle.github.io/koreye-2022/).
Thanks to [Jaroslaw Bogusz](https://www.kaggle.com/jaroslawbogusz) for the replay script.

Alpha is my running version of the bot.
KoreBeta is the version aDg4b submitted to win the Beta competition.
Miner is a simple miner from the discussions page. I only used it for debugging.
